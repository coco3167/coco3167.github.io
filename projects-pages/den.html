            About the game
        </h2>
        <p>
            DEN is an interactive diorama populated by social creatures.<br>
            The only way to interact with them is by moving your cursor in the scene.<br>
            It was made to question the observer's neutrality, and sensitize the impact on an environnement.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Note : This is more of an experience than a game. The interaction is limited, and the focus is more set on observation and patience.</i>

            My Contributions
        </h2>
        <p>
            I was a solo game programmer on this project, I worked with a Game Designer, a Sound Designer, a UX researcher and two Game Artists.<br>
            <br>
            The AI of the creatures was a main challenge, which we did overcome by collaborating a lot with the Game Designer and asked for advises by Axel Buendia, researcher in AI and director of the Cnam ENJMIN.<br>
            <br>
            For the AI I used a method called "Smart Objects", where the AIs have simple wants and the objects contain the majority of the logic needed.<br>
            A flower knows how to be eaten and tells the AIs how much they want to eat it for example.<br>
            <br>
            I also took some time with the UX researcher to add accessibility features such as close captioning and an "Automatic Mode" (ressembling a god mode to easily experiment with the AIs), those features were important to me, made me discover accessibility fields I did not knew before and helped me debug.<br>
