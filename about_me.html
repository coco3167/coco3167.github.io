    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in normandy, <!--insert pomme and fromage pic--> I liked video games since I was a kid (pokemon being my first introduction to it).<br>
        During my youth I did a lot of different sports, mainly Judo and Tennis, but I always loved team sports like Handball and Basketball.<br>
        Before high school I was a bit too much focused on classes and science (it's still a place in my heart tho).<br>
        As I grew up I tried to expand my horizon by playing guitar, doing some art, and learning clothes techniques like cross-stitch or crochet.

    <!--<p>
        My education was varied and deep, during High-School I studied Science and Arts all together.<br>
        I had a double-cursus, on one hand the classic Baccalauréat S and on the other the german Abitur in literature.<br>
        After that I went to a prépa MPSI, focusing on Maths and Physics.<br>
        I then switched to the Enjmin Computer Science Bachelor to focus on learning how to make games.<br>
        And to end it all with shimmers, I went to the Enjmin Master where I met a lot of wonderful people and finished sharping my skills.
